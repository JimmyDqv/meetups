## About Talk

**Meetup Group**: DevOps Malmö

**Date**: Tuesday, 25 February 2020

**Topic:** GitOps in action, powered by Alexa.

**Abstract:**
Nowadays development teams change applications faster and more frequent than ever before. More companies and teams move towards the DevOps way of working to be able to handle the increased development speed. GitOps is where operations and infrastructure changes are made through pull-requests. Any developer can then do production changes as long as they can open a pull-request. Git becomes the single source of truth for everything. In this session we talk about GitOps in general and demonstrate how to setup a GitOps flavoured CI/CD pipeline powered by Amazon Alexa
